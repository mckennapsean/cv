  - cover letter !

  - should I add open-source coding projects? ones I have released or contributed to? e.g. include side projects, my role, skills, and contributions. ONLY if pertinent and relevant for jobs, if it highlights something new/different that I have done and am able to do.

  - add a cover-letter like intro at top of resume for standalone?
  - focus accomplishment statements away from job tasks to contributions and highlight value you created
  - build for resume & for cv?
  - make styling consistent everywhere
  - clean up code/formatting
