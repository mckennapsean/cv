  - issue with teaching assistant / title instead of verb for first two teaching experiences

  - make file doesn't quite work, improve build process
  - build for resume & for cv?

  - cover letter !


  - transfer skills to job / work experiences
  - should work experience have more about roles & skills? short responsibilities list, main contributions, highlight skills in the text rather than elsewhere...

  - should I add open-source coding projects? ones I have released or contributed to? e.g. include side projects, my role, skills, and contributions


  - header printing issue
  - remove widows


  - clean up style/format & code
